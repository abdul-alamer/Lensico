# Lensico

Lensico is a Instagram Client for Android. It uses a very intuitive navigation by creating a so called Tab for every user the app-user follows.

## Usage
The App is currently in development. This means there can be bugs, problems or unexpected explosions. **I am not responsible for your dead cat!**

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D

## Notes
Beware of ugly code.

Bugfixes are generally welcome. If you want to contribute something which changes major parts of the app, please talk to someone with commit privileges first. Nothing is more frustrating than putting a lot of work and effort into a new feature and then having the PR rejected because it doesnâ€™t fit design-wise.

If you submit a PR you must accept the Contributor License Agreement. There is no way around that, since otherwise changing the license later - even to something more permissive! - , becomes close to impossible.
